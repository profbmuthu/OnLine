### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 1</span>

- Security  Management  in  fragmentated  
- Security  management  requires  a  holistic  approach  to  deal  with  new  types of wireless network technologies (e.g. 5G), potentially constrained networks (e.g.LPWANs), protocols and systems, that need to face the management of large and scalable deployments in any segment of network: RAN, Edge,Fog or Core segments.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 2</span>

- Security orchestrators are needed, which can enforce proper defence mechanism, in SDN/NFV-enabled systems. Challenge to interface with diverse, heterogeneous and distributed IoT controllers, NFV-MANO  (Management  and  Orchestration)  orchestrators,  Fog-Edge  entities,  SDN  controllers.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 2. contd..</span>

- Challenge to manage orchestration and placement of multiple VNFs on an NFV Infrastructure at large scale, either at the core of at the edge of the network, while dealing with scalability and security issues and additional threats that raise from the fact of using a virtualized environment.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 3</span>

- Traditional security enablers and  protocols, need to evolve and enforce manage softwarized and virtualized networks (SDN/NFV) and CPS/IoT systems. These security enablers and protocols need to be redesigned to cope with  the constrained nature of distributed IoT networks, requiring light weight crypto-protocols and solutions to be enforced in constrained (battery, memory,cpu) devices and networks.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 4</span>

- 5G imports vulnerabilities and threats coming from cloud computing, virtualization and SDN/NFV technologies. 
- Research challenge to deal with information transmission management, secure communication  channels, new security interfaces  for AAA to deal with Non-Access Spectrum (NAS) signalling, roaming security, and cope with diverse network-based mobile security threats and attacks.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 5</span>

-  New types of attacks not yet identified before that can exploit IoT networks, CPS is a key research challenge.
- In the cyber physical world, the attacker’s goal is to disrupt the normal operations of CPS, e.g. sensor readings, safety limits violation, status reports, safety compliance violation etc. and communication flows among devices.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 6</span>

- Cybersecurity  handling, especially in Critical systems, Cyber Physical Systems and IoT networks introduces challenges  due  the restrictions  and  constrained nature of devices and networks. New tools, for network scanning, analysis of digital  forensics and pen testing as well as innovative algorithms and techniques (e.g.machine learning) are needed to perform security analysis.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 7</span>

- Incident analysis to be supported by risk models, performing evaluation of incidents that combines several factors to decide, if needed, dynamically the most convenient mitigation plan to enforce. It should cover, threat analysis, data fusion and correlation from different sources different types of events to detect hidden relations and thus identify potential threats.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Challenge 8</span>

- Management and Control systems as well as Autonomous systems, such as for instance, drones, smart objects, self-driving cars, robots, etc, will need to perform self-learning to make proper intelligent decisions based oncurrent real-time situation.
- cybersecurity frameworks and systems should face the challenge of countering dynamically cyber attacks according to contextual and evolving conditions, there by providing self-healing, self-repair and self-protection capabilities.
