---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### What is <span style="color: #e49436">SPOOFING</span> Attack

- Spoofing attack is a malicious activity in order to launch attacks.
- Attack launched against network hosts, to steal data, spread malware or bypass access controls.


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (1/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436">*ARP Spoofing Attack*</span>: 
- Occurs when a attacker links the hacker’s MAC address with internal IP address. 
- This attack leads to data theft and deletion of data 
- Leads to compromised accounts, DOS and other malicious consequences.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (2/6)

- A malicious attacker reroutes the DNS translation 
- It points to a different server which is typically infected with malware 
- Can be used to help spread viruses and worms. 
- Also called DNS cache poisoning

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (3/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436">*DoS*</span>: 
- Use multiple compromised computers 
- Send spoofed IP packets of data to a specific server. 
- Server will not be unable to handle all of the requests, causing the server to overload.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (4/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436"> URL Spoofing</span>  
- URL spoofing occurs when one website appears as if it is another. 
- URL displayed is not the real URL of the site, 
- The information is  sent to a hidden web address

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> Email spoofing </span> (5/6)

- Email spoofing is the forgery of an email header
- Message appears to have originated from someone other than the actual source.
- Is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns
- People are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">IP</span>-Spoofing (6/6)

- IP Spoofing is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to machines,
- Attacker illicitly impersonate another machine by manipulating IP packets.
- Act of manipulating the headers in a transmitted message to mask a hackers true identity 
- Involves modifying the packet header
- Header with a forged (spoofed) source IP address, a checksum, and the order value.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">IP</span> Spoofing Types 

- Types of IP spoofing.
    + Blind Spoofing
    + Non-Blind Spoofing
    + Denial-of-service attack
    + Man-in-the-middle attack

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> Blind spoofing</span>

- Attacker transmits multiple packets to his intended target
- Receive a series of numbers used to assemble packets in order
- Hacker is not aware of how the transmissions takes place on this network
- He coaxes the machine to respond to his requests & analyzes the sequence numbers.
- Attacker injects data into the stream of packets without authentication

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Non</span>Blind spoofing

- Cracker resides on the same subnet as his intended target
- He is aware of the sequence of the packets.
- The attack is called the non-blind spoofing

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Man in the Middle</span>

- Two machines are communicating with each other.
- The attacker intercepts the packets sent by the systems
- He alters the packets sent between the machines.
- Sending and receiving machines are unaware their communication has been tampered.

---

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> DOS attack </span>

- DOS is Denial of Service.
- When a DDoS attack is launched, IP spoofing is used.
- Used for hiding the identify the exact machines generating reuests.
- Makes the DDoS attack more powerful.
- Difficult to identify the senders and block them.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> DDOS attack </span>

- Goal is to  
  + inflict damage on the  victim,  
  + either for personal reasons  
  + for material gain 
  + for popularity 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> DDOS attack </span>

   + Protocol Attacks and 
   + Application Attacks.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">Volumetric DDoS Attack </span> (1/2)

- Most common / simplest type type of DDoS attacks. 
- Characterized by an enormous amount of traffic 
- Inserting a reflection medium
- Small amount of traffic generates gigabits of traffic. 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">Volumetric DDoS Attack </span>(2/2)

- Target a service by sending legitimate requests 
- Request sent to DNS or NTP server using a spoofed source IP address. 
- DNS or NTP servers respond to request 
- End up responding to the source address of the request 
- Spoofed IP address is the target of the attack which then gets bombarded with the amplified data stream.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Protocol-based DDoS Attack</span>

- Focus on exploiting a weakness in Layer 3 or Layer 4 of the OSI layer. 
- Common example of a protocol-based DDoS attack is the TCP Syn Flood 
- Succession of TCP SYN requests directed towards a target can overwhelm the target and make it unresponsive. 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Application-based DDoS Attack</span>

- Trickiest Most sophisticated and stealthy attacks and harder to identify 
- Hackers leveraging application-type attacks are highly skilled 
- Hackers have deep knowledge of workings of the application. 
- Attack traffic is usually legitimate, targeting the application layer 
- Triggers back-end process and hogs the resources
