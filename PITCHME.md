### <span style="color: #e49436">What is network </span>

- NW - Group or system of interconnected people or things.
- Is a set of computers connected together for sharing resources.
- Is a telecommunications network allowing computers to exchange data.
- Computing devices exchange data with each other through data link.
- Computers are connected with cable media and / or wireless media

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Protocol</span>

- The official procedure or system of rules
- Rules for governing affairs of state or diplomatic occasion
- Protocol - set of rules and guidelines for communicating data
- Rules defined for each step of computer communication 
- Networks follow these rules to successfully transmit data.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">TOPOLOGY</span>

- Shape of a local-area network (LAN) or other communications system
- Four principal topologies used in LANs.
   + *Bus topology*: Devices are connected to a central cable, called bus.
   + *Ring topology*: Devices are connected to one another (closed Ring).
   + *Star topology*: Devices are connected to a central hub (star).
   + *Tree topology*: Combines bus and star topologies.

### <span style="color: #e49436">SPOOFING!</span>

- Is a <span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color:#e49436">fraudulent</span> or malicious practice.
- Communication is sent from an unknown source disguised as a source known to the receiver.


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">SPOOFING</span> Attack

- Spoofing attack is a malicious activity in order to launch attacks.
- Attack launched against network hosts, to steal data, spread malware or bypass access controls.


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (1/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436">*ARP Spoofing Attack*</span>: 
- Occurs when a attacker links the hacker’s MAC address with internal IP address. 
- This attack leads to data theft and deletion of data 
- Leads to compromised accounts, DOS and other malicious consequences.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (2/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436">*DNS Spoofing Attack*</span>: 
- A malicious attacker reroutes the DNS translation 
- It points to a different server which is typically infected with malware 
- Can be used to help spread viruses and worms. 
- Also called DNS cache poisoning

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (3/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436">*DoS*</span>: 
- Use multiple compromised computers 
- Send spoofed IP packets of data to a specific server.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="12000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types (4/6)

- <span style="color: #e49436"> URL Spoofing</span>  
- URL spoofing occurs when one website appears as if it is another. 
- URL displayed is not the real URL of the site, 
- The information is  sent to a hidden web address

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> Email spoofing </span> (5/6)

- Email spoofing is the forgery of an email header
- Message appears to have originated from someone other than the actual source.
- Is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns
- People are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">IP</span>-Spoofing (6/6)

- IP Spoofing is a technique used to gain unauthorized access to machines,
- Attacker illicitly impersonate another machine by manipulating IP packets.
- Act of manipulating the headers in a transmitted message to mask a hackers true identity 
- Involves modifying the packet header
- Header with a forged (spoofed) source IP address, a checksum, and the order value.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">IP</span> Spoofing Types 

- Types of IP spoofing.
    + Blind Spoofing
    + Non-Blind Spoofing
    + Denial-of-service attack
    + Man-in-the-middle attack

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> Blind spoofing</span>

- Attacker transmits multiple packets to his intended target
- Receive a series of numbers used to assemble packets in order
- Hacker is not aware of how the transmissions takes place on this network
- He coaxes the machine to respond to his requests & analyzes the sequence numbers.
- Attacker injects data into the stream of packets without authentication

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Non</span>Blind spoofing

- Cracker resides on the same subnet as his intended target
- He is aware of the sequence of the packets.
- The attack is called the non-blind spoofing

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Man in the Middle</span>

- Two machines are communicating with each other.
- The attacker intercepts the packets sent by the systems
- He alters the packets sent between the machines.
- Sending and receiving machines are unaware their communication has been tampered.

---

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="8000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436"> DOS attack </span>

- DOS is Denial of Service.
- When a DDoS attack is launched, IP spoofing is used.
