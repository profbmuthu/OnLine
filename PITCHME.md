### <span style="color: #e49436">What is network </span>

- NW - Group or system of interconnected people or things.
- Is a set of computers connected together for sharing resources.
- Is a telecommunications network allowing computers to exchange data.
- Computing devices exchange data with each other through data link.
- Computers are connected with cable media and / or wireless media

### <span style="color: #e49436">Protocol</span>

- The official procedure or system of rules
- Rules for governing affairs of state or diplomatic occasion
- Protocol - set of rules and guidelines for communicating data
- Rules defined for each step of computer communication 
- Networks follow these rules to successfully transmit data.

<span style="color: #e49436">TOPOLOGY</span>

- Shape of a local-area network (LAN) or other communications system
- Four principal topologies used in LANs.
   + *Bus topology*: Devices are connected to a central cable, called bus.
   + *Ring topology*: Devices are connected to one another (closed Ring).
   + *Star topology*: Devices are connected to a central hub (star).
   + *Tree topology*: Combines bus and star topologies.

### <span style="color: #e49436">SPOOFING!</span>

- Is a <span style="font-size: 1.3em;"><span style="color:#e49436">fraudulent</span> or malicious practice.
- Communication is sent from an unknown source disguised as a source known to the receiver.

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span> Attack

- Spoofing attack is a malicious activity in order to launch attacks.
- Attack launched against network hosts, to steal data, spread malware or bypass access controls.

### <span style="color: #e49436">Spoofing</span>-Types

- <span style="color: #e49436">*ARP Spoofing Attack*: Occurs when a attacker links the hackerâ€™s MAC address with internal IP address. This attack leads to data theft and deletion, compromised accounts, DOS and other malicious consequences.
- <span style="color: #e49436">*DNS Spoofing Attack*</span>: A malicious attacker reroutes the DNS translation so that it points to a different server which is typically infected with malware and can be used to help spread viruses and worms. Also called DNS cache poisoning,
- <span style="color: #e49436">*DoS*</span>: Use multiple compromised computers and send spoofed IP packets of data to a specific server. Server will be unable to handle all of the requests, causing the server to overload.

### Session <span style="color: #e49436">Hijacking</span>

- Hijacking is a type of network security attack
- Also known as cookie hijacking
- Exploitation of a valid computer session
- Gain unauthorized access to information/services
- TCP hijacking - used to gain access to servers
- Network hijack - Attacker takes control of a communication
