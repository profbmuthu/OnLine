### <span style="color: #e49436">What is data?</span>
- Data is information 
- It is  translated into a form that is more convenient to move or process. 
- From a business context, data is information converted into binary digital form.  
- Data comes in different shapes, sizes, and granularity. 
- It also comes with a lot of uncertainty attached.
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">What is dataset?</span>
- Data is usually collected as data points. 
- Means totals, averages, and medians are only a small part of what a data point is about.  
- Connection between data and what it represents is key to visualization. 
- Data is the key to data analysis and deeper understanding.
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">What is dataset?</span>
- Data set is a snapshot of data in time 
- It captures something that moves and changes. 
- It refers to data selected and arranged in rows and columns. 
- Column represents a particular variable.  
- Row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. Each value is known as a datum. 
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">What is dataset?</span>
- Data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows 
- Data set collection of data points forming aggregates and statistical summaries. 
- Data set generates your  means, medians, and standard deviations.
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="11000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">Data Generation?</span>
- Data is being generated faster and faster as more and more people take to the Web. 
- Customers generate data of all kinds, 
- Generated data is difficult to control.  
- Information is now widely available on external events such as market trends, industry news, and competitors’ movements. 
- Led to increasing interest in methods for extracting useful information and knowledge from data—the realm of data science.
---
### What is a <span style="color: #e49436">Types of Data</span>? 
- Data regardless of type, location, and source increasingly has become a core business asset for an enterprise 
- It is now categorized as belonging to two camps:
+ Internal data (enterprise application data) and
+ External data (e.g., web data)
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### What is a <span style="color: #e49436">Types of Data</span>? 
- There are two types of data in the real world:
+ Static data. (Collected Data). The volume of static data, for example national census data and human genomic data, will not change over time.
+ Dynamic data (Data being served continuously) Dynamic data, such as streaming log data and social network streaming data, the volume increases over time.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> BigData.</span>
- Hadoop software are revolutionizing the Internet services community 
- Achieved by building scalable systems infrastructure for data intensive applications. 
- Business best practices” - increasingly towards basing decisions off data  rather than instinct and theory
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> BigData.</span>
- Corporate thirst for systems that can manage, process, and granularly analyze data is becoming insatiable. 
- Venture capitalists are very much aware of this trend, 
- Funded no fewer than a dozen new companies in recent years 
- e.g., Netezza, Vertica, DATAllegro, Greenplum, Aster Data, Infobright, Kickfire, Dataupia, ParAccel, and Exasol), 
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> BigData.</span>
- Big Data is data in large sizes 
- It goes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to collect, manage, and process within a tolerable elapsed time. 
- Big data refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools
- Used  to capture, store, manage, and analyze data. 
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> BigData.</span>
- Big data essentially means datasets that are too large for traditional data processing systems.
- It is data that exceeds the processing capacity of conventional database defined systems. 
- It is too big, moves too fast, or doesn’t fit the strictures of conventional database architectures. 
- Valuable patterns and information, previously hidden because of the amount of work required to extract them. 
- It applies to information that can’t be processed or analyzed using traditional processes or tools. 
- The value of big data to an organization falls into two categories: analytical use and enabling new products
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### What is <span style="color: #e49436"> Characteristics of bigdata</span>
- Big data has become viable 
- Cost effective approaches have emerged to tame the volume, velocity, variety and variability of massive data. 
- Three Vs of volume, velocity, and variety are commonly used 
-  Helpful lens through which to view and understand the nature of the data 
- Helpful to understand software platforms available to exploit them. 
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### What is <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Volume</span>
- Amount of data being generated is increasing day by day. 
- Rate of increase of data is accelerating continuously. 
- Volume of data being made publicly available increases every year. 
- Organizations no longer have to merely manage their own data. 
- As data volume increases, the value of different data records will decrease in proportion to age, type, richness, and quantity among other factors. 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### What is <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Volume</span>
- Data generated from emails to Facebook posts, from purchase histories to web links, is contributing to the growth of data. 
- Current challenge is in extracting value from this data.  
- Sometimes this means particular data elements, and at other times, the focus is instead on identifying trends and relationships between pieces of data. 
- Includes the current data volume

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Velocity.</span>
- Velocity of data is the measure of how fast the data is coming in.  
- Data volume measures the amount of data available to an organization.
- Data velocity measures the speed of data creation, streaming, and aggregation.
- eCommerce has rapidly increased the speed and richness of data used for different business transactions (for example, web-site clicks). 
- Data velocity management is much more than a bandwidth issue; it is also an ingest issue.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Velocity.</span>
- Earlier companies analyzed data using a batch process. 
- A chunk of data, is submitted as a job to the server. The job gets executed and results are delivered. 
- That scheme works when the incoming data rate is slower than the batch processing rate and when the result is useful despite the delay. 
- With the new sources of data such as social and mobile applications, the batch process breaks down. 
- The data is now streaming into the server in real time, in a continuous fashion and the result is only useful if the delay is very short
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Variety.</span>
- Data can help inform intelligent policy making 
- It provides innovative kindling for investigative journalism, 
- Even when data is freely available, it can be shared using data formats that are touch for consuption.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Data Variety.</span>

- Data variety is a measure of the richness of the data representation – text, images video, audio, etc. 

- From an analytic perspective, it is probably the biggest obstacle to effectively using large volumes of data. 

-Incompatible data formats, non-aligned data structures, and inconsistent data semantics represents significant challenges that can lead to analytic sprawl.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### Types of<span style="color: #e49436"> Data Versatility.</span>
- Versatility refers to the adaptability of a system to analytical queries of varying complexity. 
- Versatility also refers to system flexibility in terms of query languages supported, and control in terms of data preparation, placement and management. 
- Within this data lie valuable patterns and information, previously hidden because of the amount of work required to extract them
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Bigdata Challenges</span>
- Increasingly, organizations today are facing more and more Big Data challenges. 
- The emergence of big data into the enterprise brings with it a necessary counterpart: agility.
- As data sizes grow, the concept of providing a single repository for all this data is not always the most practical solution.
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Benefits of bigdata</span>
- Big data analytics reveals insights hidden previously by data too costly to process, 

- It can be peer influence among customers, revealed by analyzing shoppers’ transactions and social and geographical data in real time. 

- Meaning of “real time” varies depending on the context in which it is used. 

- Real-time denotes the ability to process data as it arrives, 

- It does not permit storing the data and retrieving it at some point in the future 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Benefits of bigdata</span>
-  From the perspective of an online merchant, “the present” means the attention span of a potential customer. 

-  If the processing time of a transaction exceeds the customer’s attention span, the merchant doesn’t consider it real time.

-  From the perspective of an options trader, however, real time means milliseconds.

-  From the perspective of a guided missile, real time means microseconds. 

-  Real-time big data analytics is an iterative process involving multiple tools and systems.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop</span>
- Hadoop is based on the Google paper on MapReduce 
- Paper published in 2004, with development from  2005. 
- Hadoop was developed to support the open-source web search engine project called Nutch.
- Hadoop separated from Nutch and became its own project under the Apache Foundation. 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop</span>
- Hadoop is the best–known MapReduce framework in the market. 
- Companies have grown around Hadoop to provide support, consulting, and training services for the Hadoop software. 
- At its core, Hadoop is a Java–based MapReduce framework.  
- Hadoop remained a system in which users submitted jobs that ran on the entire cluster.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop</span>
-  Jobs would be executed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) mode. 
- However, this lead to situations in which a long-running, less important job would hog resources and not allow a smaller yet more important job to execute. 
- To solve this problem, more complex job schedulers in Hadoop, such as the Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler were created. 
- But Hadoop still had scalability limitations that were a result of some deeply entrenched design decisions resulting in Hadoop 2.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop Hive </span>(1/2)
- Hadoop Users realized that developing MapReduce programs is a very programming-intensive task, which makes it errorprone and hard to test. 
- There was a need for more expressive languages such as SQL 
- Required to enable users to focus on the problem instead of low-level implementations of typical SQL artifacts 
- Apache Hive evolved to provide a data warehouse (DW) capability to large datasets. 
- Users can express their queries in Hive Query Language, which is very similar to SQL. 
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop Hive </span>(1/2)
- The Hive engine converts these queries to low-level MapReduce jobs transparently. 
- More advanced users can develop user-defined functions (UDFs) in Java. 
- Hive also supports standard drivers such as ODBC and JDBC. 
- Hive is also an appropriate platform to use when developing Business Intelligence (BI) types of applications for data stored in Hadoop.
---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Hadoop Pig </span> (2/2)
- Motivation for Pig was similar to Hive 
- Hive is a SQL-like language, which is declarative. 
- Pig is a procedural language that works well in data pipeline scenarios. 
- Pig appeals to programmers who develop data-processing pipelines  
- It is also an appropriate platform to use for extract, load, and transform (ELT) types of applications.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436">Hadoop Hbase</span>
- All the preceding projects, including MapReduce, are batch processes. 
- There is a strong need for real–time data lookup in Hadoop. 
- Hadoop did not have a native key/value store. 
- Consider a Social Media site such as Facebook. 
- If you want to look up a friend’s profile, you expect to get an answer immediately (not after a long batch job runs).

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="2000" -->
### <span style="color: #e49436"> Horizontal Scanning </span>

- This is the common type of the scan for worms.

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>

- Term “botnet” coined from “robot networks.” 
- Robot” has a Czech derivation from the word “robotovat,” which means “to work.” 
- Botnet, therefore, is an apt definition: 
- bots are highly adaptable worker bees that do their master’s bidding

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>
- The overall architecture and implementation of botnets is complex
- Evolving toward the use of common software engineering techniques such as modularity
- The predominant remote control mechanism for botnets remains Internet Relay Chat (IRC) 
- IRC includes a rich set of commands enabling a wide range of use

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>

- Wide diversity of exploits for infecting target systems written into botnet codebases.
- All botnets include denial of service (DoS) attack capability.
- Shell encoding and packing mechanisms that can enable attacks to circumvent defensive systems are common
- All botnets include a variety of sophisticated mechanisms for avoiding detection

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>

- New botnets use different organizational techniques, including:
- Decentralized Naming Resolution. 
  + Using techniques pioneered by spammers botnets now act as their own DNS cloud, 
  + avoid centralized name resolution. 
  + Victims are instructed to use existing botnets for DNS resolution, avoiding the centralized use of naming services.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>

- Tor botnets. 
  + IRC operators have reported botnets on the Undernet network connecting from TOR exit nodes. 
  + Tor is a proxy network 
  + Uses a type of MIX-net routing to anonymize traffic. 
  + Botnets using Tor therefore pose difficult detection and response problems

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">BotNet</span>

- Tunneling bots. 
  + Increase in the number of bots that tunnel through existing protocols.
  + Bots potentially use net news, web blogs, and other resources. 
  + Fundamentally, these sorts of bots pose more of a problem for detection.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Key Loggers</span>


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Port Scan</span>



---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">SYN flood</span>


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Sniffing</span>
- Sniffing is the electronic form of eavesdropping 
- Carried out on communications, computers transmit across networks
- Sniffing involves 
  + capturing, decoding, inspecting and interpreting 
  + information inside a network packet on a TCP/IP network. 
- Acts as network probes for examining network traffic.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Packer Sniffer</span>

- Packet sniffer is a utility 
- used since the original release of Ethernet. 
- Allows individuals to capture data as it is transmitted over a network 
- Used by network professionals to diagnose network issues, 
- Malicious capture unencrypted data, like passwords and usernames.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Active Sniffing</span>

- Sniffing is performed on a switched network, known as active sniffing.
- Relies on injecting packets into the network that causes traffic. 
- Is required to bypass the segmentation that switches provided. 
- Sniffers operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model.  
- Grab whatever they see on the wire and record it for later review.

<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Passive Sniffing</span>

- Hubs see all traffic in the collision domain. 
- Sniffing performed on a hub is known as passive sniffing.
- Collision domain is a logical area of the network in which one or more data packets can collide with each other.
- Passive sniffing worked well during the days that hubs were used.

### <span style="color: #e49436">Protocols - Sniffing</span>
- Telnet and Re-login: 
- HTTP: Passwords and data sent 
- SNMP: SNMPv1 no good security. SNMP passwords sent in clear text.
- NNTP: Passwords and data sent.
- POP, IMAP: Passwords and data sent.
- FTP: Passwords and data sent.

### <span style="color: #e49436">Sniffing Tools</span>

- Wireshark.
- Tcpdump.
- Dsniff.
- NetStumbler.
- Ettercap.
- Ntop.

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Wireshark</span>
- open source  tool with GUI
- has more filtering  and sorting options,
- first window shows packet capture, second packet detail and last raw data 
- command line version called  Tshark.  
- Supports more  than  1100 protocols. 

---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">Wireshark</span>

- Supports  geolocalisation  of  MaxMind 
- Cities and localities could be seen by given IPs giving the information of origin of packets. 
- not  for  layman as it involves a lot of network layer filtering options.


---
<!-- .slide: data-autoslide="15000" -->

### <span style="color: #e49436">TCPDump</span>

- Used for packet capturing, network  monitoring  and  protocol  debugging.
- Oldest and most commonly used command line tool, 
- Free  and  open  source software.  
- used  to  read  live  capture  or already captured log file
- least overhead since no graphical  interface 
- Captures data  in  libpcap  formats,
